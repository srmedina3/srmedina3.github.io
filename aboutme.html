		<p> My name is Samantha Medina. I am a Mass Communications student with an emphasis in integrated communications and I am currently on the CSU-Pueblo dance team. My interests and passion are everything in the beauty industry. Whether it comes to skin care, makeup, perfume, hair care, and overall self care, I love to research and try new products that work good for me in my everyday life. </p>

<p>I look for quality, price, performance, and durability in each product that I use. Is it worth the money? Does it give quality results? How well does it perform? How long can this last me? These are questions I ask myself when I am trying new products. Iâ€™m so interested in the beauty industry because it is what makes me feel confident. With the right products I feel my best. </p>

<p>I have grown up as a dancer. I danced at my local dance studio for 14 years. I was on the dance team in high school all four years and now I am currently in my third year as a Wolfpack dancer for CSU-Pueblo. I have always loved getting my hair and makeup all done up for dance performances and recitals. I have used so many products throughout the years that have made me feel my best and I know work best for me. </p>

<p>Throughout the years my confidence has grown. Of course, I have had my insecurities but performing in front of crowds while feeling my best is what helped me. But I have also found confidence in myself without being all done up. Being comfortable in my own skin and embracing myself has helped so much.</p>

<p>I started mostly in high school with discovering different products. As my skin was changing I wanted to try different things that could make my skin look and feel better. I tried different skin care treatments and regimens. I then went to makeup for coverage. After I had some control of my skin with products, I wanted to find what could help my hair. I needed something to help with dryness, length, and overall health with my hair. I wanted to take care of myself and body but at the same time feel my best.</p>

<p>I love when I find a new product and I get to recommend it to someone. Knowing a product works good for me, makes me want to share with others. I have friends and family who come to me for recommendations. I learn from watching videos and others doing makeup, skin care and even hair care.</p>

<p>The beauty industry is so big nowadays. Stores like Ulta and Sephora are full of everything and anything beauty. I love what the stores stand for of expressing yourself and feeling confident. The beauty industry has made me feel my best in every way.</p>
